## Hasktorch NLP Introduction - Day2

> **Goal:** To build the linear regression model, train it and handle text file in haskell.

In this lecture, we start with a very basic [supervised machine learning](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-supervised-learning#:~:text=Supervised%20learning%20is%20a%20category,predict%20outcomes%20and%20recognize%20patterns.) algorithm: Linear Regression.

We'll introduce the basics of machine learning and hasktorch through model building.
